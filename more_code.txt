The sports I enjoy watching are mainly football (soccer) and tennis.
My favorite professional football teams to watch include the German National team, Bayern Munich, FC Barcelona, and Manchester United. 
With regards to tennis, I grew up watching Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, but enjoy watching younger players such as Naomi Osaka and Alexander Zverev.
If one were to pose the question, do I personally play sports? The answer would be yes, I play a coed sport currently called quidditch.
